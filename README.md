# FMS Web Application Project Report
## Design Decisions
Several decisions were made while developing this FMS web application. “Base.html” contains common elements such as the navigation bar, and current date that are placed in the base template. 
### Route and Template Design
The modular approach used to structure the routes and templates was also based on the module concept. Items that are generally applicable across all web pages were copied into the base page, the navigation bar, and the date at the bottom of the page. This allowed for design across the application and reduced redundancy. In constructing routes, both GET and POST methods were used to safely transfer forms for functions like shifting mobs and modulating paddock information. 
### Display and Sorting Decisions
The mobs and paddocks pages were intended to display all the corresponding data on one page but were tested in alphabetical order with each subject heading on a separate line. Additional features in the form of conditional formatting were developed to bring focus to the paddocks that have low pasture levels to ease the identification of problem areas.
### Handling Stock Movement
The input of stocks used in the calculation of pasture consumption and growth rates was to be input once a day to cut down on much movement of stocks. Failure to allow multiple moves in a day would prevent complications and new difficulties in simulating the flow of moves.
### Mobs and Paddocks Display
The major decision was about the design of mobs and paddocks for separate species all the mobs and paddocks were in one table on page and arranged alphabetically. Sorting the data also helped simplify how users would be able to move around and look for particular mobs or paddocks. 
### Paddock Editing and Addition
The update also enabled paddocks to be edited and added to the system. when creating a new paddock, a specific paddock ID is generated by the database, and users cannot change it. The total DM for each paddock is obtained from the area and DM/ha data is entered by the user of the program. 
### Pasture Growth and Consumption Calculation
A major decision was how to handle pasture growth and consumption calculations. For each paddock, these values are updated as the user clicks to move the current date forward by one day. The pasture values for each paddock are automatically recalculated based on the growth and consumption rates specified in the technical details.

## Database Questions
### 1. What SQL statement creates the mobs table and defines its fields/columns? 

CREATE TABLE mobs (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    mob_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,         
    paddock_id INT,                         
    stock_count INT NOT NULL,               
    avg_weight FLOAT NOT NULL,              
    FOREIGN KEY (paddock_id) REFERENCES paddocks(id) ON DELETE SET NULL 
);


### 2. Which lines of SQL script sets up the relationship between the mobs and paddocks Tables?

FOREIGN KEY (paddock_id) REFERENCES paddocks(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;


### 3. The current FMS only works for one farm. Write SQL script to create a new table
called farms, which includes a unique farm ID, the farm name, an optional short
description and the owner’s name. The ID can be added automatically by the
database. (Relationships to other tables not required.)

CREATE TABLE farms (
    farm_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,   -- Unique farm ID, auto-incremented
    farm_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,          -- Name of the farm
    description TEXT DEFAULT NULL,            -- Optional short description of the farm
    owner_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL          -- Name of the farm owner
);


### 4. Write an SQL statement to add details for an example farm to your new farms table,
which would be suitable to include in your web application for the users to add farms
in a future version. (Type in actual values, don’t use %s markers.)

INSERT INTO farms (farm_name, description, owner_name)
VALUES 
    ('Green Valley Farm', 'A sustainable dairy farm in the countryside.', 'John Doe'),
    ('Riverbend Ranch', NULL, 'Alice Smith'),
    ('Sunny Meadows', 'A small organic farm focused on crop diversity.', 'Robert Johnson');


### 5. What changes would you need to make to other tables to incorporate the new farms table? 
To incorporate the new farms table, a “farm_id” column would need to be added to the paddocks and mobs tables. This would establish a relationship between farms and the other entities. Foreign key constraints should be added to maintain data integrity between these tables.
